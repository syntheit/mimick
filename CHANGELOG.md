# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Mobile and narrow viewport UI overhaul: optimized component dimensions for 360px width screens, adjusted album and explore tile layouts to 2-column on mobile with uniform sizing, reduced header controls footprint, and improved overall narrow-screen usability.
- Album and explore view tile rendering now uses fixed 100px height with viewport-responsive width (via FlowBox homogeneous layout), ensuring consistent thumbnail aspect ratios and eliminating layout jitter on window resizes.
- Grid view minimum columns reduced from 3 to 2 on narrow viewports to fit within 360px width constraints without overflow.
- Added comprehensive rustdoc comments across all source files: module-level `//!` docs expanded to multi-line descriptions, and doc comments added to all public and private structs, enums, functions, and fields.

### Fixed

- Album/explore tile thumbnails now maintain uniform sizes within a viewport and display correctly at 360px window width, with no collapse on window-height changes.
- FlowBox children per line constraints adjusted (min 2, max 6 for albums) to ensure 2-column layout on mobile while limiting tile width growth on desktop.

## [9.5.4] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Per-folder sync rules: each watch folder can be set independently to **Upload only**, **Download only**, or **Full sync**. Bidirectional sync deletions (local→remote, remote→local) are configurable per folder and independent of the sync method, with both off by default (#120).
- Periodic remote-album reconciler (5 min) so changes made directly on Immich mirror back without waiting for the next startup scan (#120).
- Pre-flight checksum dedup before upload (batched on startup, per-asset on live events) and local rename detection so renaming doesn't cause an upload+trash cycle (#120).
- Three-tier local trash (`gio` → XDG portal → manual XDG) for reliable trashing of Flatpak document-portal paths (#120).
- Documented Immich API key permission requirements end-to-end: README/wiki tables, in-app welcome and field subtitles, 401/403 error guidance, and a troubleshooting entry (#120).
- Asset generator tool overhaul and testing wiki page (#118); Codacy badge in the README (#116).

### Changed

- Split three large modules into directory modules with focused submodules to improve incremental compile times: `library/mod.rs` (3725 LOC → 7 submodules), `api_client.rs` (2224 LOC → 6), `settings_window.rs` (2173 LOC → 2). No behaviour change (#117).
- Album→folder local trash is gated off until the upstream Flatpak portal trash bug is fixed; the settings toggle is disabled with an explanatory subtitle (#120).
- Info logs are quieter — internal mechanics moved to debug; `MIMICK_PROFILE=dev` defaults to `mimick=debug` (#120).
- CI: switched workflows to `ubuntu-latest`, decoupled the two Flatpak manifests' build triggers, removed the deprecated maintainer-approval workflow, and CodeQL now sets up Rust + `cargo fetch` for reliable extraction.
- Dependabot: bumped `taiki-e/install-action`, `github/codeql-action`, `flatpak/flatpak-github-actions`, and `release-drafter/release-drafter` (#119).

### Fixed

- Live file-monitor events no longer re-upload already-synced files. The `MonitorEvent::Ready` handler now consults `ShardedSyncIndex` via `sync_decision` before queueing, mirroring the startup-scan path. Without this, `PollWatcher` (Flatpak's polling watcher for portal FUSE paths) could lose its internal "seen" state under heavy I/O and re-emit Create events for unchanged files.
- Multiple deletion-safety fixes in the new sync engine: strict `album_id` match so re-targeting a folder doesn't mass-trash local files; per-album reconcile lock so manual + periodic sync can't race; two-tick confirmation for batch deletions >5; assets present elsewhere on the server (in another album, or referenced from another watch folder) are kept or only de-associated rather than fully trashed; orphan classification requires physical absence on disk (#120).
- Immich base64 asset checksums normalised to hex at deserialisation; self-induced filesystem events suppressed so own trash/download no longer propagate back as sync work; live monitor clears sync records only after the server op succeeds so transient failures retry on the next tick (#120).

## [9.5.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Back navigation in the library window. The header bar now includes a back button (Alt+Left) that returns to the previously visited view (Photos, Album, Explore, etc.). A nav-history stack is maintained per library source — searches are not pushed since they're ephemeral, and consecutive duplicates are coalesced. The button is disabled when there's no history to return to.
- Lightbox image zoom support via Ctrl+scroll wheel, trackpad pinch gesture, on-screen `−` / `+` / `100%` button group, and Ctrl+`+` / Ctrl+`-` / Ctrl+`0` keyboard shortcuts. The current zoom percentage is shown in the centre button (click it to reset to fit). The zoomed image scrolls within the viewer for panning. Zoom level resets to fit-to-window when navigating between assets.
- Lightbox slide animation when navigating between images. Forward navigation (next button or Right arrow) slides the new image in from the right; backward navigation slides it in from the left. Falls back gracefully when GTK animations are disabled in system settings.
- Configurable test-asset generator script for reproducing deduplication and startup scan benchmarks across all supported API asset formats (#101).
- Graceful shutdown for in-flight uploads. Quitting the app now stops accepting new tasks, waits up to 5 seconds for active uploads to finish cleanly, then cancels anything still in flight via a cancellation token. Uploads cancelled at the deadline are persisted to the retry queue and resumed on the next launch instead of leaving partial assets on the server.
- Profile switcher for development and testing via the `MIMICK_PROFILE` environment variable. Each named profile (`MIMICK_PROFILE=dev`) gets fully isolated state: its own config file, sync index, retry queue, thumbnail cache, and keyring entry. The GTK application id is varied per profile so multiple profiles can run simultaneously without activating each other's windows. Portal folder grants are shared across profiles since they are scoped to the Flatpak app-id.

### Changed

- Disk thumbnail cache is now pruned on a 10-minute background interval instead of only at startup, and its cap was raised from 500 MB to 1 GB so long sessions no longer grow unbounded.
- Consolidated the three previously hand-maintained extension/MIME tables (file watcher, upload client, library enumerator) into a single `phf` perfect-hash registry. Eliminates table drift and turns the watcher's hot-path extension check from a 68-entry linear scan into an O(1) lookup.
- Hardened security by adding strict path sanitization against directory traversal on downloads, and enforcing `http`/`https` scheme validation for server URLs (#98).
- Centralized read/write lock configuration access into `AppContext`, eliminating redundant disk parsing and streamlining context usage across modules (#98).
- Replaced standard non-async locks (Mutex/RwLock) with `parking_lot` for faster operations, and added `atomic_write()` for crash-safe file persistence (#98).
- Eliminated single-lock bottlenecks by replacing the monolithic `SyncIndex` with a 16-shard `ShardedSyncIndex` backed by `RwLock` shards (#99).
- Significantly improved startup scan speeds by rewriting it as a two-stage parallel pipeline using `rayon` for fast directory enumeration and bounded asynchronous queueing (#99).
- Added a worker pool cap to file monitor events with backpressure channels rather than unbounded blocking spawns (#99).
- Implemented a custom `LibraryAssetModel` replacing the monolithic `gio::ListStore` to enable client-side sorting independently of server retrieval (#100).
- Memory unbounded growth issues when scrolling large remote libraries are resolved using a new 400-asset sliding window with FIFO eviction (#100).
- Implemented background lookahead thumbnail prefetching and lowered scroll trigger thresholds so thumbnails pop in faster while dragging down the grid (#100).
- Added formal sorting support (`SortOrder`) across metadata and OCR search endpoints from the client side (#100).
- Relocated the server connection status indicator from the sidebar top to the bottom for better visibility and layout balance.
- Removed the redundant checkbox toggle icon from the library header bar; selection mode is now managed via Ctrl-hold or keyboard interaction.
- Removed support for `.xmp` files from the media scanning and MIME detection logic as they are not utilized by the application.
- Removed the "Sync State" option from the library sort dropdown; it was only meaningful in unified/local views and produced no useful ordering in the standard photos view.
- Transfer direction in the progress bar is now shown as an icon (`mimick-upload-symbolic` / `mimick-download-symbolic`) rather than the text prefix "Uploading" / "Downloading", keeping the label focused on the active filename and speed.

### Changed

- Explore page Places section now shows all cities with geotagged assets instead of only the small popular subset returned by `/api/search/explore`. A new `fetch_all_places` method pages through all assets with EXIF city data, collecting unique cities and a representative thumbnail asset per city.

### Fixed

- Details pane timestamps (Taken and Created) no longer display the raw UTC ISO 8601 string with a confusing `+00:00` suffix. A new `format_datetime_display` helper parses the timestamp and formats it as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, stripping the offset indicator so the displayed time matches the unambiguous value Immich recorded.

- Search pagination — particularly OCR search — now uses Immich's `nextPage` field as the source of truth instead of a "did we get a full page?" heuristic. Previously, when Immich's search response post-filtered results (for visibility, archive, library scope) it returned short pages even with more matches available, causing pagination to stop early and hide the rest. Applies to all four search endpoints (Smart, OCR, Metadata, Advanced) and to album/unified variants that route through the same endpoint.
- Closing the settings window no longer also closes the library window when background sync is disabled. The "quit when settings closes" path now checks for other open application windows first and only quits when settings was the only window left.
- Settings: the "Enable Library View" toggle, "Open Originals in Lightbox" toggle, and "Thumbnail Memory Cache (MB)" spinner now save immediately on change instead of requiring a click on the connection-save button. Each handler skips the disk write when the value matches the existing config (avoids redundant writes during initial population).
- Settings: the connection-save button has been renamed from "Save Connection Settings" to "Save Credentials" so the action label matches what the field group is actually about (URL + API key).
- Concurrent workers racing to create the same album on first run now serialize via a per-album-name lock with double-checked cache lookup, preventing N duplicate albums being created simultaneously (one per queued file).
- `fetch_all_albums` now collapses concurrent callers into a single network request via a fetch lock with double-checked `albums_fetched` flag. Previously, concurrent startup-scan workers each fired an independent `GET /api/albums`, then re-inserted the same entries and reported every album as a false-positive duplicate.
- Duplicate album detection now compares IDs within a single server response (built into a fresh map before replacing the cache), so "same name, same ID" entries from a re-fetch are ignored silently while genuine server-side duplicates (same name, different ID) still warn and keep the first.
- `refresh_album_cache` now holds the fetch lock across its clear → reset → refetch sequence, closing a race where a concurrent in-flight fetch could populate the cache after the clear but before the reset, leaving the cache empty with the flag set to true.
- Sync index state is now flushed to disk when the upload queue goes idle, ensuring a clean restart never re-queues already-uploaded files even after an immediate exit following a fast batch.
- Sync index is now flushed on graceful shutdown (tray quit, window close) so records written since the last 10-second periodic flush are not lost.
- SIGINT and SIGTERM signals now route through the GTK graceful shutdown path instead of killing the process immediately, so uploads drain, retries persist, and the sync index flushes before exit.
- `flush()` in the sync index now clears dirty bits only after a successful write. Previously, a failed `atomic_write` (e.g. disk full) would silently mark shards clean, causing subsequent flush calls to skip them and permanently lose the unwritten records.
- Removed a broken auto-flush trigger in `record_synced` that fired when `shard.entries.len()` was a multiple of 50 — this checked total entry count, not dirty-since-last-flush count, so it fired unpredictably and never for small datasets. Flush scheduling is now handled solely by the 10-second timer and idle-queue flush.
- Concurrent `check_connection` callers (queue workers, library ping loop, main loop) now serialize via a single-flight lock. Callers that arrive while a probe is already in flight coalesce onto its result within a 1-second window, eliminating redundant LAN/WAN ping bursts at startup without suppressing the 5-second library re-check.
- Escape key and Clear button now properly exit selection mode entirely instead of just clearing selected items.
- Asset sync status in the lightbox details pane and thumbnail hover now reflects the asset's true state (local only, remote only, or both) instead of being implied by the active view. Root cause: Immich returns SHA-1 checksums as base64 in API responses while the sync index stores them as lowercase hex; the representations are now normalised on read so checksum-to-path reverse lookups resolve correctly across all views including unified and album-unified.
- In-app symbolic icons (`mimick-upload-symbolic`, `mimick-download-symbolic`) are now compiled into the binary via `glib-build-tools::compile_resources` and registered at startup with `gtk::IconTheme::add_resource_path("/dev/nicx/mimick/icons")`, replacing a `theme.add_search_path(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"))` call that resolved to a nonexistent path in all non-`cargo run` environments.

## [9.5.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Right-click context menu on grid assets with download, open-with, and delete actions gated by asset type and source.
- Sync status icons (cloud/computer/check) and centered video badge overlay on grid thumbnails, replacing the old generic icon.
- Auto-refresh library surfaces after album creation, bulk delete, download completion, and album sync mutations.
- Queue inspector launchable from the library header bar, with enlarged dialog and improved long-path rendering.
- Settings save acknowledgement dialog on explicit save.

### Changed

- Updated `h2` and `tower-http` dependencies and removed unused `iri-string` dependency.
- Bumped `github-actions` dependencies (`taiki-e/install-action` and `github/codeql-action`).

### Fixed

- Sync index is now stored in the persistent data directory instead of the cache directory. Clearing the app cache no longer wipes sync state or triggers a full re-upload. Existing index files are migrated automatically on first run.
- Ctrl+click selection no longer skips the first asset. Holding Ctrl now reveals checkboxes transiently; clicking an asset commits the selection. Releasing Ctrl without clicking dismisses selection mode.
- Local and unified views for linked albums are now scoped to the selected album's linked folder only, instead of showing assets from all linked albums.
- EXIF orientation is now applied to thumbnails and lightbox images via `apply_embedded_orientation()`. Stale thumbnail cache entries are invalidated with a new cache key version.
- Details pane is now fixed at 320px width with `max_width_chars` constraints on labels so it no longer resizes dynamically with image dimensions.
- Grid view thumbnails now use a fixed 356px width (16:9 at 200px height) instead of expanding to fill available space.
- Explore page places grid and album tab tiles are now sized at 300x220px with a horizontal meta row layout (name left, count right) matching the explore page grid style.
- Consolidated duplicate refresh buttons by removing the sidebar refresh button and keeping the status bar one. Added F5 keyboard shortcut for refresh.

---

## [9.5.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Startup view no longer forced to Settings when background sync is disabled; the default window (Library if enabled) now opens correctly.
- Direct navigation between Album and Explore views now works without routing through Photos first.
- Default folder name albums now auto-link to the correct remote album and no longer create duplicate config entries on re-save.
- Folder-linking UI is now hidden when navigating to Explore or Albums from within an album view so it only appears in relevant contexts.
- Local asset count in album sync no longer double-counts files reached via symlinks or duplicate paths.

### Changed

- Removed `--env=MESA_LOG_LEVEL=error` from Flatpak manifests

---

## [9.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- New Library View feature for browsing assets in-app with dedicated library navigation and interactions.
- Foundational library module components were introduced, including shared state wiring through `AppContext` and a dedicated library surface.
- Library search expanded with metadata filters, timeline search, OCR-selectable search dimensions, and random asset search.
- New Explore surface added for people, places, and things with integrated fetch flows.
- Library sidebar now includes album-focused navigation and source-aware controls for browsing.
- Local source enumeration was added for library integration and settings-driven source visibility.
- Asset details now include EXIF model support and richer asset-detail fetching.
- Albums view added with Recent, Owned, and Shared sections, plus in-app album creation.
- Album synchronization support added for library workflows.
- Thumbnail cache now supports ThumbHash + Base64 data paths for faster preview rendering.

### Changed

- Library source switching logic was refactored for readability and cleaner state transitions.
- Explore view and sidebar composition were refactored to simplify state management and UI behavior.
- Thumbnail loading/caching was reworked to reduce redundant fetches and improve cache initialization behavior.
- Thumbnail decode/load paths now use cancellation-aware, bounded work to smooth scrolling under heavy grids.
- Streaming downloads, disk-cache pruning, and sync-condition checks were optimized for runtime efficiency.
- App identifier references were renamed from `io.github.nicx17.mimick` to `dev.nicx.mimick` across desktop and project configuration.
- Documentation was updated to cover library view behavior and permissions in current builds.

### Fixed

- Grid view CSS states and layout behavior were polished for more consistent library interactions.
- Asset download error handling in library-related fetch paths was improved.

## [9.4.2] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Revised app logic to background sync. Now if background sync is disabled app won't persist in background when closed using window close button. App startup will open the settings window for the same. Quit action will work the same (Close the app).

- UI: about section is now moved to title bar

## [9.4.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Stream startup scan candidates directly into the upload queue to reduce startup memory churn.

### Changed

- Fetch Immich albums immediately after saving connection settings.
- Parse album list responses into typed structs instead of generic JSON for safer handling.
- Use local time for quiet-hours checks.
- Reduce cloning of folder status state during settings UI refresh and avoid cloning the sync index during persistence to improve performance.
- Increase settings window startup width while preserving the 360px minimum mobile layout target.

### Fixed

- Fix live watcher queue metadata after settings changes so queue state remains consistent.
- Prevent the settings window from auto-saving partially populated UI state.
- Avoid creating albums during startup scan inspection and ensure album creation only happens when appropriate.
- Fix Application action buttons so About and Quit keep matching visual and touch target sizing.
- Initialize the Pause button label from the real queue state on first render.
- Fix install method card overflow so cards remain within the install block width.

### Removed

- Removed unused legacy config fields and dead monitor code.
- Removed the grain/noise background effect from the site theme.

## [9.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Settings: Live auto-apply for most preferences (workers, quiet hours, folder rules, per-folder album selection, watch-folders). Connectivity fields (API key and server URLs) are now applied only when explicitly saved from the Connectivity section.
- Single-batch sync summary notification: multiple concurrent upload workers now aggregate results and emit a single "processed" summary notification when a sync batch completes.
- Flatpak packaging now targets the GNOME 50 runtime for current desktop compatibility.
- GitHub Pages repository pipeline now dynamically generates a `mimick.flatpakref` file for one-click graphical installations.

### Changed

- Logging: Console output is colorized by level and file logs use a plain, machine-friendly formatter with automatic rotation (approx. 2 MB per file, keep 5). See README and wiki for configuration details.

## [9.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- New notification toggle. Allow user to enable or disable the notifications sent through the app

### Changed

- Replaced `secret-tool` (libsecret CLI) with the `oo7` Rust crate for credential storage. Inside Flatpak, credentials are now stored in a portal-encrypted file within the sandbox. On native installs, the desktop's D-Bus Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) is used directly. This eliminates the `user interaction failed` error that occurred when `secret-tool` tried to render a prompter dialog across the Flatpak sandbox boundary.
- The `.flatpakrepo` file now includes a `RuntimeRepo` directive pointing to Flathub. This allows Flatpak to automatically resolve and download the required GNOME Platform runtime on systems where Flathub is not pre-configured (notably Ubuntu 25+ and certain Fedora spins).
- Removed `libsecret` / `libsecret-1-dev` from build prerequisites. The `oo7` crate is pure Rust and requires no system-level keyring library at build time.
- Removed hardcoded `GSK_RENDERER=gl` from Flatpak manifests. GTK4 now auto-detects the best renderer (Vulkan, NGL, GL) for the host GPU.
- Removed unnecessary `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets` from Flatpak manifests. The `oo7` crate uses the Secret portal inside the sandbox and does not need direct D-Bus access to the host keyring.
- Added `MESA_LOG_LEVEL=error` to Flatpak manifests to suppress harmless Mesa driver developer warnings (FINISHME notes) from cluttering application logs.
- Consolidated all documentation from `docs/` into the project wiki. The `docs/` markdown files have been removed to prevent drift.

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate URL toggle validation handlers that caused two error dialogs to appear when disabling the last enabled URL switch.
- Added missing config fields (`startup_catchup_mode`, `upload_concurrency`, `quiet_hours_start`, `quiet_hours_end`) to the diagnostics redacted export and plain-text summary.
- Fixed Flatpak installation failing with `org.gnome.Platform was not found` on fresh Ubuntu and Fedora installations that do not ship Flathub enabled by default.

## [9.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- Added support for`SingleMainWindow=true` to the `.desktop` launcher to better integrate with GNOME 50+ dock contexts preventing redundant "New Window" options.
- Migrated desktop notifications from the `notify-send` system command to native `gio::Notification`, fixing the issue where notifications would silently fail inside the Flatpak sandbox.
- Notifications now correctly display the app's SVG icon natively via the XDG Notification Portal constraint.
- Removed redundant async blocking wrappers (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`) around notification dispatches, delegating instead directly to `glib::idle_add_once`.
- Cleaned up redundant branch metadata keys in the Flatpak manifests to optimize build parsing.
- Refined the "Startup Catch-up Mode" drop-down label length in the Settings UI so it no longer visually clips within its ComboRow box.

## [9.1.1] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- Switched Flatpak repository to correctly advertise as `stable` instead of defaulting to a `beta` channel badge.
- Reconfigured the Flatpak repository builder workflow (`flatpak-repo.yml`) to exclusively deploy on new tag releases rather than on every push to the `main` branch.

### Fixed

- Fixed an internal GTK critical focus assertion error (`box != NULL`) that occurred when opening the folder rules configuration dialog.
- Fixed a bug where a discarded failed-upload task could leave a persistent "Pending: 1" ghost label on the folder configuration UI across application restarts.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Expanded supported media formats to match latest Immich server: AVIF, BMP, HEIF, JPEG 2000, JPEG XL, PSD, SVG, 3GPP, AVI, FLV, M4V, Matroska (MKV), MP2T, MXF, and more. The app now recognizes and uploads all Immich-compatible image and video extensions.

### Changed

- The settings window now explicitly follows the desktop light/dark appearance preference at startup, allowing light mode when the system theme is light.
- The `Status` page now uses a standard symbolic page icon for more consistent rendering across icon themes.
- Flatpak packaging now targets the GNOME 50 runtime for current desktop compatibility.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Fixed an Immich asset timestamp regression where newly uploaded files could land at the wrong timeline time or lose their intended timezone after server-side metadata processing.

### Changed

- Upload metadata handling now preserves filesystem-based creation times more reliably and reapplies the local timezone after upload so Immich keeps the correct asset date placement.
- The settings window now uses `Status` and `Settings` pages, shows the first-run API-key guidance at the top of the configuration flow, and no longer forces dark mode.
- `Save & Restart` has been replaced with live `Save Changes` behavior that updates the running API client, queue policy, upload worker count, and watched folders without relaunching Mimick.
- Watch-folder changes now reconfigure the live filesystem monitor in place, so adding or removing folders takes effect immediately after saving.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Health Dashboard**: A visual status area on the Controls page showing active server route, watched folder count, pending items, recent retries, and latest errors.
- **Per-Folder Status**: The settings UI now displays the pending queue count and last sync time specific to each configured watch folder.
- **Permission Health Checks**: On startup, Mimick now verifies that it still has read access to all configured directories. If a Flatpak permission is lost, a warning is prominently displayed.
- **Safer Startup Catch-Up Controls**: Added a "Startup Catch-up Mode" dropdown in settings allowing users to limit startup scans to "Recent Changed Only (7 days)" or "New Files Only" to save on disk I/O.
- **Actionable Errors**: Meaningful connection failure and folder access loss messages replace generic request timeouts.
- **Better Album Picker**: The per-folder album selector is now a modal search dialog. Users can filter existing Immich albums by name, pick the default folder-name behavior, or type a new name to create an album on the fly.
- **First-Run Wizard**: When no API key is configured, Mimick automatically opens the Setup page and displays a welcome banner. The "Save & Restart" button is disabled until an API key is entered, preventing silent broken-connection states.
- **Notifications That Matter**: Replaced per-file notification spam with a single batch summary notification that fires once a sync cycle completes. Added a dedicated "Connection Lost" notification that fires after consecutive failures.
- **Upload Concurrency**: Users can now configure between 1 and 10 parallel upload workers in the settings, allowing for better tuning based on network capacity.
- **Quiet Hours**: Added a configurable quiet-hours window to pause uploads during specific hours of the day (e.g., to prevent impact on nighttime network usage).
- **Mobile Responsive UI**: Refactored the settings window from a rigid `adw::ApplicationWindow` to a native `adw::PreferencesWindow`. Primary controls and action buttons now use adaptive `FlowBox` layouts that auto-stack vertically on narrow displays (down to 360px), ensuring the app is fully usable on Linux phones and small monitors.
- **Adaptive Folder Rows**: Watch folder entries now use `adw::ExpanderRow` to hide additional settings (Album, Rules, Remove) until clicked, maximizing screen space on mobile.

### Fixed

- Fixed an "endless loop" bug where offline network conditions caused already-synced files to be incorrectly re-queued for reassociation.
- Fixed an issue where the processed file count in the UI would increment infinitely during network failures.
- Fixed a bug where a previously selected album target reverted visually to a "Custom Album" field after an application restart.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- A queue inspector in the settings window with recent queue activity, failed-item visibility, per-item retry actions, `Retry All Failed`, and `Clear Failed Queue`.
- Manual sync controls in both the settings window and tray menu with `Pause / Resume` and `Sync Now` actions.
- Per-folder sync rules for ignoring hidden files, limiting maximum file size, and restricting allowed file extensions.
- A diagnostics export bundle that writes a support-friendly snapshot containing a summary, config copy, status cache, retry queue, sync index, and log file without including the API key.
- Best-effort environment-aware pausing for metered-network and battery-power operation.

### Changed

- Startup scans and live monitoring now apply the same per-folder rule checks and temporary-file filtering before queueing uploads.
- Shared runtime state now records recent queue events, pause reasons, the last completed file, and diagnostics export counts for better visibility and supportability.
- The settings window now separates `Setup` and `Controls`, uses a slimmer layout, and keeps `Close`, `Quit`, and `Save & Restart` pinned in a footer.
- Documentation now covers the new sync controls, diagnostics workflow, per-folder rules, and current test/packaging flow.
- CI and Flatpak publishing documentation now match the current `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, and containerized Flatpak build setup.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- A startup catch-up scan that walks watched folders on launch and queues media that was missed while Mimick was not running.
- A local sync index that records previously synced files so unchanged media can be skipped quickly on later startups.

### Changed

- Changing the target Immich album for a watched folder now causes unchanged files to be reassociated to the new album on a later startup instead of being ignored.
- If a previously targeted album no longer exists, Mimick now refreshes album resolution and retries with the current configured album target.
- Terminal and file logs now include timestamped detailed formatting for easier troubleshooting.
- Flatpak tray integration now uses a narrower StatusNotifier permission model and no longer requests broad `org.kde.*` bus-name ownership.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- GitHub releases now attach a signed `mimick.flatpakrepo` file and a `SHA256SUMS.txt` checksum file for easier end-user installs.

### Changed

- The GitHub Pages Flatpak repository workflow now signs published repo metadata with a dedicated GPG key and embeds the public key in the generated `.flatpakrepo` file.
- The release workflow now uses the same Flatpak signing key material from GitHub Actions secrets so release assets match the published repository trust chain.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- A built-in **Run on Startup** setting that requests desktop-portal background permission in Flatpak builds and writes a native autostart desktop entry outside Flatpak.
- Friendly folder labels for portal-backed watch directories, so selected Flatpak folders show names like `Screenshots` instead of raw `/run/user/.../doc/...` paths.
- Real **Save & Restart** behavior that relaunches Mimick after settings are saved.
- Explicit **Close** and **Quit** actions in the settings window, plus a launcher **Quit Mimick** desktop action.
- A published GitHub Pages landing page for the Flatpak repository with direct install instructions and repository links.

### Changed

- Flatpak builds now use selected-folder access through the file chooser portal instead of `--filesystem=home`.
- Folder monitoring inside Flatpak now uses a polling watcher so portal-backed directories continue to sync reliably.
- Local Flatpak development builds now use the same selected-folder permission model as the deployed app.
- App quit paths now shut down gracefully instead of using a hard process exit from the tray.
- The Flatpak repository landing page has been redesigned with a simpler, more cohesive visual style and a one-click copy action for install commands.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- Added Flatpak packaging support
- Removed default photo watch path configuration on startup
- Polished AppStream metadata for Flathub compliance

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Complete Rust Port**: Entire application rewritten from Python/PySide6 to Rust + GTK4 + Libadwaita. Binary drops from ~80MB (PyInstaller bundle) to ~2MB.
- **Tokio async runtime**: Concurrent upload workers (configurable, default 3) with streaming `reqwest` multipart — constant RAM regardless of file size.
- **In-memory shared state**: `Arc<Mutex<AppState>>` replaces disk-based IPC polling. No disk I/O during normal operation.
- **`flexi_logger`**: Logs written to both stdout (systemd) and `~/.cache/mimick/mimick.log` for persistent debugging.
- **Tray via `ksni`**: StatusNotifierItem tray using a `tokio::sync::watch` channel — no zombie processes, no D-Bus spawn.
- **Duplicate upload prevention**: `active_tasks` HashSet in the file monitor prevents multiple `wait_for_file_completion` tasks for the same file during long writes (e.g. screencasts).
- **App ID standardized**: Unified to `io.github.nicx17.mimick` across the binary, `.desktop`, `.metainfo.xml`, icons, and install scripts.
- **AppImage packaging**: `build_test_appimage.sh` compiles a release binary and assembles a standard AppDir in 5 steps.

### Changed

- Settings window uses hide-on-close (built once per process) — eliminates repeated GTK widget tree allocations.
- `ImmichApiClient` is a singleton (`OnceLock`) — single `reqwest` connection pool for the lifetime of the process.
- Autostart now uses `io.github.nicx17.mimick.desktop` symlink.
- All documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `TESTING.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `APPIMAGE_CREATION.md`) updated for Rust/Cargo.
- GitHub Actions release workflow updated for Rust toolchain.
- CodeQL analysis updated to use `languages: rust` with `build-mode: none`.

### Removed

- All Python source files (`main.py`, `settings_window.py`, `tray_icon.py`, etc.)
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `MANIFEST.in`

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Renamed repository and backend strings from `immich_sync_app` to `mimick`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Complete Rebranding to Mimick**: Officially renamed the project from "Immich Sync" to "Mimick" to establish a unique identity and drop the generic moniker. All internal app IDs, metadata, documentations, and daemon variables have been fully synchronized.
- **GTK4 / libadwaita Migration**: Totally replaced the heavy PySide6 UI framework with a native, responsive GTK4 + libadwaita interface. The application now perfectly mimics the native look and feel of modern GNOME and KDE desktop environments.
- **Scalable Vector Icons**: Modernized app icon integration by deploying the high-resolution `mimick.svg` into system `hicolor/scalable/apps/` directories.

### Changed

- AppImage build scripts and installation loops have been completely restructured to support the new `mimick` nomenclature and GTK requirements.
- Standardized the GNOME window `StartupWMClass` bindings effectively preventing stray or duplicate launcher icons on Wayland/X11 desktops.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **AppImage Python 3.12 Bundle**: Overhauled AppImage scripts to download and bundle a standalone `python-build-standalone` payload, resolving missing C-Extension (`Pillow`) bugs on modern OS hosts (like Ubuntu 24).
- **GTK AppIndicator Native Support**: Added `PyGObject` to the packaged environment and successfully bridged host GUI drivers via `GI_TYPELIB_PATH` to ensure system tray icon features don't crash under isolated packaging.
- **Duplicate Album Creation Race Condition**: Implemented `threading.Lock()` on the `get_or_create_album` REST endpoint to ensure multiple simultaneous workers handling bulk image drops to new directories don't spawn multiple identical albums on the server if they bypass the cache at the same time.
- **Ubuntu 24 Tray Icon Crash**: Added graceful try/except block wrapping around the `TrayIcon/pystray` initialization loop. On modern Desktop Environments (Ubuntu 24 Wayland / Mutter) that deny AppIndicator injection, the application no longer permanently fails. Instead it safely disables the visual tray while dropping seamlessly into a headless background daemon. Launching from the GUI menu with the tray disabled intelligently loads the Settings Window.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **File Move/Rename Support**: `ImmichEventHandler` now captures `on_moved` watchdog events. Temporary file downloads (e.g. `video.mp4.tmp` from web browsers, rsync, Syncthing) that later rename internally to a valid media extension are now successfully captured and pushed to the upload queue.

### Fixed

- **Incomplete Video File Upload Bug (`wait_for_file_completion`)**: Prevented massive media files (like 30-minute GUI screencasts) from triggering early timeouts before they were fully written. Replaced absolute 10s wait logic with an adaptive 300-second _idle_ timeout loop; continuously growing items dynamically rest the counter keeping uploads safe regardless of copy duration.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Animated UI Toggles**: Added custom beautiful `SlideSwitch` CSS animations to the Settings Window allowing users to visually toggle Internal (LAN) vs External (WAN) URL behaviors on and off.
- Config now persists `internal_url_enabled` and `external_url_enabled` booleans.
- Expanded testing coverage for `api_client` and `config` including advanced error-state simulation and file-system failure catching.

### Fixed

- **Captive Portal Bug Fix**: The API Ping routing logic now strictly requires a `{"res": "pong"}` JSON payload resolution to avoid falsely pinging local cafe Wi-Fi captive portals and breaking sync loops.
- **Failover Cache Reset Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where a timeout connection to the Internal URL loop would not flush the active API endpoint causing the logic to effectively loop blindly instead of bouncing sequentially to the External URL.
- Fixed critical App UI freezing (App Not Responding) during testing connection pings syncing via a synchronous socket process - now visually wraps tests via Qt override wait cursors.
- **Queue Offline Resolution Fix**: Fixed a data-loss bug that permanently flushed queued failed uploads if the user closed the window. Implemented `~/.cache/mimick/retries.json` to seamlessly save pending cache limits, accompanied by an explicit background locking worker loop restoring files successfully.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- AppImage distribution! A new fully packaged AppImage version of `mimick` is now available, bundling `PySide6` and all Python dependencies into a single, highly portable executable.
- Introduced `AI_CONTEXT.md` to help agentic tools understand the application's unique multi-threaded API architecture, system constraints, and X11/Wayland workarounds.

### Fixed

- Fixed critical Qt 6 Wayland connection error where the DBus portal rejected window launching (`Could not register app ID`). Application metadata is now strictly set before Qt engine initialization.
- Fixed a metadata warning regarding the `.desktop` suffix in Qt's `setDesktopFileName` handler.
- Fixed buggy AppRun bash script backslash escaping that was causing `Exec format error` exceptions inside generated `AppImage` distributions.
- Fixed a bug where native AppImages were trying to execute `main.py` outside of isolated module logic.

### Changed

- Promoted project status from Alpha to properly release `v0.2.0` (removed beta tags completely from code structure and internal About tags).
- Modified API `_ping` function tests from testing generic text formats to raw JSON validation checks.
- Added robust direct-file editing scripts to fully automate AppImage extraction, generation, and packaging (`build_test_appimage.sh`).
- Updated PySide6 dependencies and application system documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`).

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Created `AppImage` deployment script and comprehensive guide for easy Linux distribution natively bundling `PySide6` and python libraries.
- Extended testing suite to cover `notifications`, `tray_icon`, and `state_manager` using fully mocked implementations.
- Implemented desktop entry integration and `install.sh` enhancements standardizing icons to `/usr/share/pixmaps`.
- Added new AppImage-specific helper scripts (`install-appimage.sh` and `uninstall-appimage.sh`).
- Added User Guide (`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`), Testing Guide (`docs/TESTING.md`), and Architecture Guide (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) to assist end-users and developers.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and initial project scaffolding.
- Added modern structural badges and active Alpha-phase developmental warnings to the `README.md`.
- Properly credited application icon to Unsplash's Round Icons.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue on GNOME/X11 where the application icon would not render in the dock or settings window due to misaligned `.desktop` metadata (`StartupWMClass`).
- Revised the `install.sh` routine to ensure Python virtual environment integrity and `pip` availability before attempting dependency installation.

### Changed

- Transitioned project license from MIT to **GPL-3.0**.
- Refactored PySide6 window initializations to fallback to a reliable absolute image path as opposed to breaking natively on XDG theme engines lacking caching.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` metadata for publishing (PyPI readiness), adding GPLv3 and Alpha classifiers.
